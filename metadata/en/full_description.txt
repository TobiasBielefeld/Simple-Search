A very basic app designed for people who want to use a search widget with their preferred search engine.

This app contains a search bar to type in a search query, which will be opened in the Internet browser. A widget for the home screen will simply start the app.

You can modify or delete existing search engine and also add infinite custom search engines. The app also saves up to 20 search queries as a history.
